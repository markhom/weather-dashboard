## Overview
The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for weather information in a specific city. It fetches current weather data and a 5-day forecast from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for a city by name, and the application will display the current weather and forecast in Fahrenheit (`°F`). The application also keeps track of previous searches, storing them in local storage, and automatically loads the last searched city's weather data upon page load.
